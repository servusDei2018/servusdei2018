# hi 👉😺👈

hi hi hi my name is Nate 😺, and I'm a ✝️ Roman Catholic ✝️, a ✨ software developer ✨, and a 🇨🇭 lifeguard 🇨🇭 

## about me

I speak English (my native tongue), and a little Spanish. I can read and write Latin, having taken it for three years (Henle). I love programming, and I know **Python 2/3**, **Go** (my language of choice), **ANSI C**, **JavaScript** (full-stack), and **HTML5/CSS/XML/JSON/YAML**.

I'm enthusiastic about the outdoors, and I love kayaking, canoeing, fishing, and hiking. I love reading many many great books (Aquinas, Aristotle, Plato, Homer, Virgil, Lucretius, Epictetus, Aurelius, Dante, Chaucer, Newton, Pascal, Kant, etc.), and my favorite play is Goethe's *Faust*. O'Neill's *Mourning Becomes Electra* is superb, too.

## what i do

I love
